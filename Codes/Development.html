						<p>
							The book follows the journey of Michael, who is a father and husband, on his personal 	development journey. Michael meets a elderly man named Charlie who begins to teach him the books namesake The twelve pillars of success. Michael learns the importance of setting goals in both short and long term. He realizes the first step in attaining a goal is conceptualizing it.Charlie states that they can be no change without a few pains and said change cannot happen overnight but you can start the process immediately.
							</br></br>
							I could learn a lot from this as I don't often think of the future as a matter of fact I often avoid doing so. This has led to me missing opportunities as i couldn't see the future benefits. To begin anything you first have to know what you are doing and I will employ this concept to my life.
							
						</p>
						
						<q>
							Set the goal and work backwards 
						</q>
						<p>
							Charlie Then Introduces Michael to the concept of Time Management- spending your days in the best way possible. Charlie states he has lived a good life and done all the things he has wanted and he is now a old man. Others have found themselves at his age without every realizing their dreams and now they can't do anything about it. They die with regrets. It is important not to just prioritize what should be done now but make time for planning ahead. Make time for what you want not just what you need.
							</br></br>
							Regrets are painful as you keep thinking of what you could have done instead to change the outcome.I have realized that thinking in the long term is quintessential to avoid regrets and I have made steps in that direction.
						</p>
						<q>
							Either you run the day or the day runs you
						</q>
						<p>
							Michael then learns the power of influence. Specifically how the energy of the persons around  		you;friends,family,co-workers can affect your life.Charlie states that persons can either have positive,negative or neutral impact on ones life and as such it is important that you pay attention to the company that you keep. Success breeds success and Charlie advises that you must surround yourself with what you want to become. Ultimately only you can determine your attitude but through subtle interactions your mind can change, your thought process becomes different.Charlie states that it is important to have friends not by convenience but by choice. This may result in you losing friends but change is necessary to grow.
							</br></br>
							This is a very common phenomenon where a person gets famous and their friends claim they have 
							"changed". But the sad reality is certain lifestyles will never make you successful and you will have to change. This can lead to friends no longer having any common ground or qualities thus they drift apart. I value my friendships and try to associate with persons who share my sensibilities.
							However everyone has blind spots and I try to reevaluate my relationships every no and again.
								
						</p>
					
						<q>
							Attitude is greatly shaped by influence and association
						</q>
						<p>
							Michael is then thought the importance of self-education. A formal education will get you started but the ability to acquire new knowledge is a skill that can lead to great fortune. The skills you learn by living and interacting with others, the lessons learned through experience are just as valuable as a college degree.Charlie highlights that knowledge is the beginning of all things health,wealth and spirituality. Charlie states reading is the best way to gain knowledge and improve ones life. Even Michael is very much against the idea Charlie assures him that there is much to gain by reading. You can explore different worlds, scenarios and peer into the minds of some of the most notable persons in history. By exposing yourself to these ideas to can expand your way of thinking and grow as a person.
							</br></br>
							I realized that even an education doesn't guarantee success. There are persons with Masters Degree who are unemployed and as such you have to be flexible with how you approach education. There are things I learnt during my time working that have made me a better person and as such I have always tried to be open to new information.
						</p>
						<q>
						Learning is the beginning of wealth

						<h3>My journey</h3>
